> Replace the markdown image paths with real files once screenshots or screen recordings are captured. For video, store in shared Google Drive and link from the training group chat.

## Feedback collection
- **Immediate:** End-of-session stand-up asking "Apa yang paling sulit?" (What felt hardest?). Note responses in meeting notes.
- **Follow-up:** Create Google Form with 5 questions (ease of use, photo steps clarity, variant wizard clarity, suggestions).
- **Tracking:** Add UI tweak suggestions to product backlog board; label with `Training Feedback`.

## Post-session tasks
1. Trainer updates **data_capture_progress.csv** to mark participants certified (add to `notes`).
2. Share screenshots/videos + cheat sheet PDF via WhatsApp group.
3. Schedule refresher micro-session during Day 3 buffer if error rate >10%.
